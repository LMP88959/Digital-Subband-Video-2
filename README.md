# Digital-Subband-Video-2
------

DSV2 is a lossy video codec using wavelets and block-based motion compensation.
It is designed for medium-low to medium-high bitrates.
Comparable to MPEG-4 Part 2 and Part 10 (H.264) (P frames only) in terms of efficiency and quality.

### Note PDFs are out of date. They reflect the codec as it was when it was first uploaded here.

## DSV2 Features (refer to PDF in repo for more detail)

- compression using multiresolution subband analysis instead of DCT
   - also known as a wavelet transform
- up to quarter-pixel motion compensation
- 4:1:0, 4:1:1, 4:2:0, 4:2:2 (+ UYVY) and 4:4:4 chroma subsampling formats
- adaptive quantization
- in-loop filtering
- intra and inter frames with variable length closed GOP
   - no bidirectional prediction (also known as B-frames). Only forward prediction with previous picture as reference
- only form of entropy coding is interleaved exponential-golomb coding for simplicity

## Improvements and New Features since DSV1

- in-loop filtering after motion compensation
- more adaptive quantization potential
- skip blocks for temporal stability
- new subband filters + support for adaptive subband filtering
- better motion compensation through Expanded Prediction Range Mode (EPRM)
- quarter pixel compensation
- psychovisual optimizations in the codec and encoder design


--- for more detailed information please refer to the informal specification document (DSV2_spec.pdf) in the repository.

## Encoder Features (specific to this implementation of the DSV2 spec)

- single pass average bitrate (ABR) or constant rate factor (CRF) rate control
- more advanced Human Visual System (HVS) based intra block mode determination
- new Human Visual System (HVS) based intra frame adaptive quantization
- more complex scene change detection
- hierarchical motion estimation
- better temporal adaptive quantization
- written to be compatible with C89

--- for more detailed information please refer to the encoder information document (DSV2_encoder.pdf) in the repository.

## Limitations

- no built-in interlacing support
- only 8 bits of depth per component supported
- frame sizes must be divisible by two

This code follows my self-imposed restrictions:

1. Everything must be done in software, no explicit usage of hardware acceleration.
2. No floating point types or literals, everything must be integer only.
3. No 3rd party libraries, only C standard library and OS libraries for window, input, etc.
4. No languages used besides C.
5. No compiler specific features and no SIMD.
6. Single threaded.

## Compiling

### C Compiler

All you need is a C compiler.

In the root directory of the project (with all the .h and .c files):
```bash
cc -O3 -o dsv2 *.c
```

### Zig build system

If you have Zig installed, you can use the build.zig file to compile the project. Building requires Zig version â‰¥`0.13.0`.

0. Ensure you have Zig & git installed

1. Clone this repo & enter the cloned directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LMP88959/Digital-Subband-Video-2
cd Digital-Subband-Video-2
```

2. Build the binary with Zig:

```bash
zig build
```
> Note: If you'd like to specify a different build target from your host OS/architecture, simply supply the target flag. Example: `zig build -Dtarget=x86_64-linux-gnu`

3. Find the build binary in `zig-out/bin`. You can install it like so:

```bash
sudo cp zig-out/bin/dsv2 /usr/local/bin
```

Now, you should be all set to use the compiled `dsv2` binary.

Only .yuv (one file containing all the frames) and .y4m files are supported as inputs to the encoder.

## Notes

This codec is by no means fully optimized, so there is a lot of room for performance gains. It performs quite well for what it is though.

## Example videos:

All videos are encoded at 30fps with a GOP length of 12.
The H.264 file sizes were within a few kilobytes of their respective DSV2 file size.
H.264 examples were encoded using https://github.com/lieff/minih264 using -speed0 (best quality)
DSV2 examples were encoded with -effort=10 (best quality)
