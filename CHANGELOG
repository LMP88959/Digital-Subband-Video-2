DSV 2.7 - May 16, 2025
    Better and faster motion estimation through better candidate MV selection and reducing diagonal searches
    Better rate control including the addition of CRF encoding (finally)
    More accurate inter/intra mode decision and RDO
    Temporal + anisotropic motion compensation for better subpixel motion
    Intra frame deringing filter
    Inter frame cleanup filter
    Fast local de-gradient / sharpening filter to reduce blurriness
    Haar is used at L3 rather than a longer filter now to reduce both ringing artifacts and also increase sharpness
    Simplified HZCC a bit
    Refactored decoding code
    YUV 4:1:0 support
