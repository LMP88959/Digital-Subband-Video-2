/*
 * BC2 is a pseudo-perceptual lossy (irreversible) color space designed to have
 * relatively low decoding complexity and be integer-only while also performing
 * (perceptually) better than YCbCr for lossy compression.
 *
 * Other recent perceptual color spaces include XYB (from JPEG-XL) and Oklab.
 * BC2 is different because its primary focus is speed not accuracy.
 *
 * Naming:
 *
 * B stands for brightness - representing something similar to luminance
 * BC2 == BC^2 == BCC
 * The 1st C stands for Chroma Significant (green-red)
 * The 2nd C stands for Chroma Insignificant (blue-yellow)
 *
 * Besides the two chroma channels, the ^2 also refers to the fact that the
 * BC2 color space approximates the forward and inverse gamma curve by
 * replacing it with squaring and sqrt, respectively, for increased performance.
 */

/* NOTE this implementation operates on:
 * =========================================
 *        sRGB as 8-bit per channel:
 *     R[0...255] G[0...255] B[0...255]
 * =========================================
 *        BC2 as 8-bit per channel:
 *   BR[0...255] CS[48...251] CI[45...234]
 *
 *
 *    if "full_range" is set to 0,
 *       BR ranges from [16...235]
 *
 *     CS and CI are centered around 128
 *    where 128 means there is no chroma
 *      contribution from that channel
 * =========================================
